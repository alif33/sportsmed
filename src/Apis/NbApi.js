    title: "Lonzo Ball having surgery means what for the Bulls?",
    desc: `Bottom line is probably not much this year, IF reports so far are accurate. He’s expected back in 6-8 weeks - well before the playoffs in April - and he should bounce back quickly to his pre-injury level (13 pts, 5 reb, 5 ast). No major short term risk of re-injury here, so expect minimal impact on Lonzo and the Bulls 2022 playoff run.

    Long-term, meniscus tears tend to shorten careers and affect in-season durability, and this is unfortunately Lonzo’s second go-around with his left knee. Dwayne Wade comes to mind as another NBA star who underwent multiple meniscectomies. Especially towards the end of his career, we saw his load managed to keep the knee from acting up.
    
    Luckily, Ball plays a less aggressively explosive style than Wade did, and he’s young enough (24) that he probably still has 5+ years before he sees any real impact. What happens after that time is hard to predict, but NBA data suggest that’s when the wear and tear on this knee could come into play. Hopefully he gets this issue treated and it never bothers him again, but it wouldn’t be surprising to see a load management situation develop late into his career.
    
    It’s worth discussing the caveat above that these predictions hold up only IF reports so far are accurate. We’re hearing that Lonzo has a small tear, and reported return timelines imply that they are removing - rather than repairing - the torn meniscus in his knee. Generally, meniscus surgery comes with the possibility of repairing the tissue - a decision made based on size, location, and tissue quality - which is better in the long run, but would also likely shut down Lonzo through the whole playoffs. Sounds like they’re leaning away from this, but it’s definitely on the radar that reported timeline post-surgery could be a lot longer than what we’re hearing now. We’ll be keeping a close eye on this one.

    desc: `We’re hearing 4 weeks on the timeline for Anthony Davis, but don’t expect to see him in action that soon. They’ll have to examine him and see how the healing has progressed first. If everything is going great, he’ll need at least 1-2 weeks to progressively ramp back up his activity. With negative X-rays plus the injury video, we can infer that Davis has a grade 2 mid-foot sprain. Most of these in the NBA and NFL heal without surgery, but the average time missed is just over 5 weeks.

    If the Lakers are in contention, Davis may decide to accelerate his timeline, but earlier return means higher risk of re-injury. By playoff time - if the Lakers make it - Davis should be back playing at a high level, but we wouldn’t bet on an MVP performance starting day 1 of his return. Really bad luck here, but our fingers are crossed for a smooth recovery for the big man`,

    title: `Is Kawhi coming back? The question - like Kawhi - is complicated, but Natwa (@fantasydocs) and I lean towards no. Here’s why:`,
    desc: `(1) Kawhi tore his ACL in July, so he’s now 7 months into recovery. Earliest possible clearance is at 6 months, but NBA players average 10. Coming back too early puts him at risk for re-tearing or even injuring his other knee. 10 months would mean a May return, and it’s pretty uncommon to see a player miss a whole season and try to jump straight into the most high-intensity games of the year.

    (2) Kawhi’s history. We don’t know exactly what happened behind the scenes in San Antonio, but we know it involved distrust between Kawhi and the Spurs medical team that stemmed from them clearing him when he didn’t feel mentally/physically ready. That incident, plus Kawhi’s well-known history of load management, together give us the impression that Kawhi won’t tend to be aggressive about his return timeline.
    
    (3) Paul George and the 8 seed. PG has been out, and the Clippers have since fallen to borderline playoff team status. They’re currently sitting at 8th, meaning they’re looking at an opening round against the Suns. Even if they improve slightly, they’re facing the Warriors or Grizzlies. Realistically, are you expecting to beat any of those 3 teams without giving Kawhi and PG13 a re-acclimation period to get their chemistry back and knock off the rust? Probably not..`,

    desc: `Jamal Murray is coming up on 11 months post-ACL. League average for return is 10, but it’s very reasonable to take it slowly. Look for Murray back on the court at some point this month.

    And what level of player are we going to see? Probably an All-Star, or close to it.
    
    NBA production dips in the initial return from ACL reconstruction, but tends to pick back up over the following year. Young players and high accuracy shooters like Murray are partially protected from the decline, so expect to see Murray at ~85% of his pre-injury level of production.
    
    The Nuggets still won’t be our favorites to win the West, but do look for them to make some noise with both Murray and Michael Porter Jr. nearing return in March.`,

    title: `Chris Paul is reportedly out 6-8 weeks with a thumb avulsion fracture. NBA Playoffs start in 7 weeks, so will the injury impact the Suns? Probably not. Here’s why:`,
    desc: `(1) 6-8 weeks is a relatively conservative estimate here. These injuries used to keep athletes out for longer, but with modern surgical technique that average is now 5 weeks.

    (2) The fact that a piece of bone broke off here actually helps him. Bone-to-bone healing is faster than ligament-to-bone healing. The 5-week timeline above includes athletes who needed ligaments to heal to bone. If anything, Paul should be on the lower side there. (For the medically curious, the thumb ulnar collateral ligament is the key here.)
    
    (3) The injury hasn’t tended to decrease NBA player production once they get back to the court. Expect his ramp up to take no more than 1-2 weeks.
    
    Data is pretty thoroughly in his favor here. The Suns betting odds are 4.5 to 1 for the championship and 1.8 to 1 for the Western Conference. If those numbers start to creep upwards, you’ll find us at Caesars putting in our Phoenix Suns “investments”.`,

    desc: `(1) Timing. March 10 has the Nets at Sixers highlighted on the calendar of every NBA fan. Philly fans are harsh, and Simmons has a giant bullseye on his back. Easy to see why he might not want to debut there.

    (2) He’s been off all season. We can’t imagine that he’s been doing anything but training and resting over the last 8 months, and we’d therefore think that his body is feeling as good as it ever has.
    
    Maybe the ramp up in contact practices since he joined Brooklyn have caused some issues, but it would definitely not be the most likely outcome here. Either way, we will see Simmons soon. Durant is on the mend, and we’d forecast March 15 against the Magic as the release date for the full new edition Nets. That gives them a month to figure out how to mesh together. So curious to see if Simmons fixed his jumper since we last saw him.`,

    title: `KlayDay is HERE! Klay Thompson’s injury luck has been BRUTAL, but his resilience is INSPIRATIONAL.`,
    desc: `Today - after tearing his ACL and Achilles - he’s remarkably coming back to the game. But what does he have left?

    We project an All-Star, especially on the offensive end.
    
    ACL and Achilles tears both tend to decrease NBA player production when they come back, BUT that effect is much lower for sharpshooters - and there’s hardly anyone better there than Klay Thompson.
    
    If he’s lost a step, it will probably be on defense. These injuries tend to decrease rebounds, steals, and blocks, but even at 90% of his previous level, he’s still excellent.
    
    With that in mind, we’re looking at Warriors +275 to win the West as a steal at the moment. As Klay plays - and demonstrates exactly what he has left - that line should become much less favorable over the next couple of months.
    He tore his ACL, and followed that up with a torn Achilles on the other leg. For an NBA player in his prime, “brutal” barely scratches the surface here. With undeniably admirable resilience, Klay has worked his way back, and we’re now seeing signs that he should be returning to the court within the next 3-5 weeks.
    
    But after these injuries, will he have anything left?
    
    We dove deep on the data, and our answer is YES.
    
    The ACL generally results in a 1-year decline for NBA players, but they tend to bounce back to baseline afterwards. The Achilles has a more profound effect, causing lasting decreases in PER and game participation for most wing position players.
    
    Luckily, both of these effects are blunted for players with lethal perimeter shots. We DO expect Thompson to have lost a step compared to the 2019 version of himself, but we don’t anticipate seeing its effects too glaringly on the offensive end.
    
    He’ll have to work his way back into the fold, but don’t be surprised to see Klay return to his ~20 PPG form by the time playoffs come around. It’s less realistic to expect the return of his All-World perimeter defense, but you may still see this in brief spurts during crunch time. Overall, expect borderline All-Star caliber play from this Splash Bro when he comes back.`,

    desc: `Can’t imagine the currently 10th place Pelicans rushing him back now. He’s been off of that foot for a while so needs plenty of re-conditioning. But this injury should now be basically behind Zion, which is a huge win itself. Re-fracture rates are low, and performance tends to bounce back to pre-injury trajectories.

    Look for a strong, healthy start to next season from Zion. His fans have strong reason to breathe a big sigh of relief today.`,
