    desc: `I’m truly sorry for your loss. His production was nothing like you expected, and your investment probably costed you your fantasy season. If you’re not too scorned to consider re-drafting him, I’d propose you do just that. Here’s why:
    (1) The injury. Saquon came directly off of the ACL tear this year, and he followed the trend that most RBs have shown us. Production dips in the first year back, but generally returns to baseline in the year after that. Athletically, he showed it to us in spurts, but couldn’t maintain that level consistently throughout the season. Part of that is probably related to his body re-acclimating to the demands of the NFL.
    
    (2) The other part is his team. Daniel Jones did not inspire confidence, and the O-line was subpar at best. But now the Giants have 2 top-10 picks, and that line could get a HUGE boost (or 2) this offseason. Multiple franchises - like the Colts and Chargers - have shown us how drastically different an offensive line can look from one year to the next. All the Giants have to do is stand pat, pick 2 studs, and unleash the athletic freak that is Saquon Barkley.`,

    desc: `ACL re-tears typically take WRs longer to recover from than first-time tears (13 months vs 10 on average. The protective structures of the knee - meniscus and cartilage - both take big hits in ACL Round 2, so we see shorter NFL careers with more missed games along the way. Production can bounce back to pre-injury baseline, but takes a while to get there.
    Players CAN return as early as 6-8 months from surgery, but it means greater risk and lower level of recovery. I can understand the need to get back quickly, but this might not be the best move. I’d anticipate that November return projection getting pushed back as the time gets closer. I’d be unsurprised to see him out the entirety of the coming season, but a late ’22 comeback is not out of the question.",

    title: `Antonio Brown. What an eventful week.`,
    desc: `Lots to say so let’s dive right in.

    Regarding his ankle, was the injury serious?
    
    His statement yesterday tells us that answer is yes, very serious in fact.
    
    He has a torn ligament, loose bone in the ankle, and cartilage damage.
    
    So with that long list, was it even appropriate to ask him to play?
    
    NFL players of course play through a lot.
    
    In this case, Brown was going to need surgery eventually.
    
    The question was really about timing.
    
    Pain level here was undoubtedly not small.
    
    But if he could play through it in a way that keeps him effective, allows him to protect himself from 300 pound defenders, and he’s not going to make things drastically worse, then yes he could play.
    
    Most likely, he was going to attempt this, and have the ankle treated with surgery in the offseason.
    
    But after trying, Brown said it was too painful, and if a player doesn’t feel physically able, there’s plenty of medical data to say that he’s at risk by being out there.
    
    We know this ankle had been injured for a while this year.
    
    Temporarily treating the pain with injections to make it through a couple of games and a playoff run is not an unreasonable strategy as long as Brown was informed and on board.
    
    It sounds like he was willing to try, so very reasonable to have him out there to start the game.
    
    But once he says it’s too painful to make football moves, that’s where the line is drawn.
    
    What was actually said on the sidelines is under dispute and we may never know.
    
    But Brown is still a star player.
    
    His stats in his 6 games this year were strong, and he was a top 12 fantasy wide receiver in 4 of those weeks.
    
    And so now will he be back?
    
    From the injury side, I would very much expect that answer to be yes.
    
    He’s going to have ankle surgery, but should be at full speed in the 3-6 month range depending on what exactly they find at the time of surgery.
    
    Even on the longer end of that spectrum, he’s back in time for training camp and Week 1.
    
    The cartilage damage to the ankle puts it at risk of flaring up again during a season, but his level of play by Week 1 and really as long as he stays healthy, should be very similar to what we saw this year.
    
    Fantasy owners in dynasty and keeper leagues should plan to hold onto him.
    
    Re-draft players should put him on their target lists as a late-round value pick who could very realistically be a top 10 wide receiver at the end of next year.`,

    title: `The Jaguars backfield is expected to have fantasy value in ‘22. A year of growing pains under Trevor Lawrence’s belt, a full off-season without Urban Meyer’s distractions, and a series of high draft picks that could turn into O-line help are potentially the perfect storm for a Travis Etienne breakout. Can you trust him coming off of the Lisfranc injury? Here’s what you should know:
    `,
    desc: `(1) Return to play takes NFL players an average of 10-11 months. That’s great news for Etienne, who tore his Lisfranc in August. Even 11 months to come back makes him a healthy starter well before Week 1.

    (2) Post-Lisfranc performance dip. Offensive skill position players seem to have a hard time bouncing back from this injury in the short-term. RBs in the SportsMedAnalytics database see a decline in their productivity. Working in Etienne’s favor are young age and exceptional pre-injury athletic metrics (average ~80th percentile for the categories relevant to Lisfranc). Overall, our injury analytics algorithm tells us to expect nearly the same quality of player as before injury.
    
    (3) James Robinson. He’s still under contract with the Jags, but he’s coming off of an Achilles tear in December. NFL RBs have typically averaged ~1 year to return, but Cam Akers has reset our expectations to be closer to the 6-8 month range. While Robinson will likely be back at or near the start of the season, we anticipate him being ~80% of his pre-injury self. That should mean more opportunity for Etienne, who we already know that the Jaguars want to feature heavily based on his high draft position.
    
    Overall, we like Etienne at his current ranking ~RB20. His dual-threat ability gives him a low-RB2 floor but an RB1 ceiling. What more could you want at that point in a draft? @fantasyfootball.360 and I will be targeting him for sure.

    title: `Analysts are all over the map on Chris Godwin coming off of ACL and MCL tears to his knee. Respected writers have him as high as WR7 and as low as WR30. So what’s the move? Consider this:
    `,
    desc: `(1) The timing of his return. Godwin had surgery in January. NFL players average 10-11 months to return, and WRs tend to fall on the higher end of that timeline because sharp cutting and explosive jumping require the most strength from that knee. Optimistically that’s a mid-October return to play.

    (2) The ACL performance dip. Natwa @fantasydocs talks about this a lot, and data proves that it’s real. Year 1 for WRs tends to be hard, at least in their first games back. We see decreased production that bounces back to baseline by year 2 (sooner for some of the elite players). OBJ was a perfect example of this (before his re-tear in the Super Bowl).
    
    (3) Athleticism. Godwin is tremendously productive, but we’re analyzing the athlete separate from the overall player here. Metrics at the combine measure Godwin athletically at 80th percentile, just a few behind OBJ. The SportsMedAnalytics algorithm predicts the recovery of his stats on the relatively early side for his position.
    
    Putting it all together, we’re predicting Godwin back in mid-October, but not giving us full-strength results until mid-November. He certainly could be a difference-maker by the time fantasy football playoffs roll around, but there’s no chance we’d take him over DeAndre Hopkins, Jaylen Waddle, Diontae Johnson, or Tyler Lockett. It’s even hard to justify Godwin over Brandin Cooks, Hunter Renfrow, and Jerry Jeudy. For us, WR 35 - over Brandon Aiyuk and Christian Kirk - is where we’d pull the trigger on Godwin.

    Hopkins has been one of the most durable WRs in the league for years, and his time in Houston showed us that he can put up numbers with or without a functional QB. Don’t worry about his knee, don’t worry about Kyler, and draft Hopkins with WR1 confidence.

    (3) ADP. @FantasyPros has him at slot 49, around the likes of Michael Pittman Jr. and Brandin Cooks. You can snag a good WR there, but it’s a much deeper position. Importantly, Waller is the lowest-ranked of the elite tight ends, so spending a 5th rounder to get Waller over a 3rd to pick Kyle Pitts or George Kittle is highly appealing.
    
    Kittle has to deal with QB uncertainty, and Mark Andrews and Travis Kelce are going in rounds 1 or 2, so I’ll be targeting Waller or Pitts heavily. Hopefully my league-mates aren’t reading this to do the same.

    `,
    desc: `It’s reasonable to be skeptical of Williams’s doctors publicly stating that he’s going to get back to his sub-4.3 speed. Are they being honest or mostly having their patient’s back?

    In this case, probably both.
    
    Wide receivers after ACL tears tend to lose a step in the initial return, but gain it back over the course of their first 12-18 months after surgery.
    We saw Odell Beckham Jr this year put up strong numbers about a year after his ACL injury (timing confounded by the trade to the Rams dynamite offense). His Rams teammate and now record-holder Cooper Kupp is 3 years removed from his surgery and clearly thriving as a star wide receiver.
    
    The take-home message is that young players in their prime tend to recover, and without much lasting deficit from ACL surgery. The injury is associated with shorter careers and fewer total games played over the course of NFL careers, but that effect is also less drastic in 1st round draft picks like Williams projects to be.
    
    So when will we see Jameson Williams back?
    
    Probably not in time for the start of the season. Early return timetables are in the 8-9 month range, but given his young age and large draft capital investment it’ll take to acquire him, it would be a shocker to see anyone try to rush Jameson Williams back to the field.
    
    Instead, we’d expect this to be closer to the average - 10 months - and perhaps longer. That pushes Williams into November - 2/3 of the way through the NFL season - before making his debut.
    
    Dynasty and keeper league fantasy football owners should have Jameson Williams at the top of their late round selection list as a value steal who could definitely turn into a Pro Bowl receiver. Re-draft teams with deep rosters and/or an IR spot could definitely benefit from having him too, but we would avoid using a limited roster spot on a player likely to miss the majority of the coming year.
    
    Now the interesting question becomes what will happen to William’s draft stock going forward. Hopefully this bad luck doesnt cost him too much $ and he recovers without a hitch.`,

    title: `Robert Woods coming off an ACL tear is being rated ~WR30 by most fantasy sites. What do we think about that?
    `,
    desc: `(1) The first question is always when he’ll be back. Woods tore his ACL in November, meaning the 10-11 month average timeline would put him back in the game around mid-September. He says he’s on track for mini-camp, so it sounds like he’s going to be on the aggressive side with his return. Not an uncommon mentality for a WR nearing age 30.

    (2) Second is production. WRs tend to dip in fantasy points during year 1, and then bounce back to baseline. The SportsMedAnalytics algorithm factors in combine metrics, age, and time from the injury to generate predictions that have been tested and re-optimized using data going back ~20 years. Unfortunately, it doesn’t love the outlook for Woods. His average combine percentile is ~40, he’s up there in age for an NFL wideout, and he’s going to start the season on the early side for returning players. Not exactly lined up for success.
    
    (3) Third for us is team fit. Woods’s role is unthreatened with OBJ out for likely the whole year with an ACL re-tear. Sean McVay is an offensive genius, and Matthew Stafford is a stud. We saw Jared Goff improve in yards, completion percentage, and TDs from year 1 to 2 with McVay. With added familiarity, chances are that Stafford will have at least as successful of a statistical year as he did in ’21. This is the selling point on Woods.
    
    But for us, it’s not enough to overcome the injury analytics. There’s a lot working against Woods here, and while we definitely expect him to return and contribute, his ceiling is not stellar. We agree with one of IG's highest-accuracy analysts - @fantasyfootball.therapist - who has Woods as a mid-WR3.
    
    That ceiling isn’t going to be enough to justify taking him over the guys ranked nearby - Amon-Ra St. Brown, DeVonta Smith, Jerry Jeudy, Marquise Brown. So while we’ll be rooting for Woods - as we do for every player persevering through a major injury - we’re not looking to target him at all in fantasy drafts for 2022. Are you?`,
